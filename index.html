			<h2 class="text-center">Depeche Mode best album</h2>

			<h3 class="text-right">Violator</h3>
			<section class="p-3">
				Depeche Mode fans can disagree on a lot of things, that much is for sure, but I think the majority embraced <b>Violator</b> as the band’s creative peak. Even 27 years later it’s still an almost perfect masterpiece that balances light and dark, and gloomy introspection and forward pop tunes that somehow all work perfectly well together in that specific line-up. Following the big sound of Music For The Masses, Depeche Mode picked a more subtle and reduced setting, gave Gore’s sweet blues guitar a more prominent spot and even got a few techno vibes on board. Combine that with the perfect visual scenery created by Anton Corbijn and you get an example of how a profound pop record could actually look and sound like. <br>
				The best hits of this album are <b>"Personal Jesus"</b> and <b>"Enjoy the Silence"</b>
