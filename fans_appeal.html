					I'm working on some tunes of my own now and would love to get some feedback from depeche fans. my link is below if you are intersted.
					Also, I'm not new to the board, just made a new account with this name.

				<div class="col-8 col-md-10 bg-light">Will people's replies be about the band member's work or not?
					For example if it is a DM cover, the replies are more likely to be about the band/artist doing the cover, not the DM song itself: NOT DM related.
					If it's about DM fans but the topic itself has nothing to do with DM, then it's NOT DM related.<br>
					If it's about another band mentioning DM on a song, interview, etc: NOT DM related (it's more about the other band, right?)
					Former band members and different projects: NOT DM related. (e.g.: Erasure, Yazoo, Recoil) The line has become a bit blurry on this though. It's up to you, depending on the particular topic.<br>
					DM fans complaining about the forum: Direct your VALID concerns to the moderators, don't create threads for this :P
					Thank you.

				<div class="col-8 col-md-10 bg-light">Lately, I've been closing threads A LOT. I've posted my own "search feature" tutorial but... the truth is that if I were paid a dollar for every time I read the "Sorry if this has been posted before..."
					So what's the deal? I'll be monitoring the amount of new threads created and the goal is to keep that number to a minimum.
					Want to talk about a song? A concert in a given city? New tour dates near you? Get to use that search feature. Give it a try. Get creative. Go see where the results can lead you to.
					Revive old threads and find out what other fans thought and said about a topic you may be interested in.
					I'll choose randomly from all the people who create new threads about topics that haven't been covered before (remember, the goal is to keep that number LOW) and from all the people who find old threads to revive, so it's not necessary to be a thread starter...
					Please don't start trivial or controversial (politics and religion) threads, those are not eligible for this contest and get closed regardless. You'll have to choose your new topic very carefully.
					If you do revive a thread, but find multiple threads about the same, please take a look and post to the most interesting and/or popular in your opinion.
					The main goal is to keep the board clean and keep the amount of new threads to a minimum. Well, to the necessary. Plus, you'll get acquainted with the search feature and you'll enjoy your board experience more.
